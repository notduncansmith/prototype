    <h2>Hello world!</h2>
    <h3>And goodbye &ldquo;environment setup&rdquo;</h3>
    <p>Tired of logging hours and hours of time to "environment setup"?  Well, I was too.  Getting started on a new project required downloading Boostrap, jQuery, <kbd>touch index.html</kbd>, etc.  Nasty. <em>But, no more!</em></p>
    <p>With this nifty prototype application, you can hit the ground running on your next project.  Just clone this repo, run <kbd>install.sh</kbd> (just gathers dependencies and does the initial build), and you're good to go!</p>
