    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>And goodbye &ldquo;environment setup&rdquo;</h2>
    <p>Tired of logging hours and hours of time to "environment setup"?  Well, I was too.  Getting started on a new project required downloading Boostrap, jQuery, <kbd>touch index.html</kbd>, etc.  Nasty. <em>But, no more!</em></p>
    <p>With this nifty prototype application, you can hit the ground running on your next project.  Just clone this repo, run <kbd>install.sh</kbd> (just gathers dependencies and does the initial build), and you're good to go!</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>jQuery</h2>
    <p>Because Bootstrap needs it, and let's face it: you'll probably want it.</p>

    <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
    <p>The most widely-used grid framework in the known universe.</p>

    <h2>Gulp</h2>
    <p>Because you should only need to run one command to get your dev environment running, and it's a lot less hairy than Grunt.</p>

    <h2>LiveReload</h2>
    <p>Do you like constantly hitting <kbd>F5</kbd>? Me neither.</p>

    <h2>LESS</h2>
    <p>Because LESS is powered by Javascript, and plays nicely with Bootstrap.</p>

    <h2>Bower</h2>
    <p>Because managing front-end dependencies by hand is for cavemen.</p>

    <h2>.gitignore</h2>
    <p>You'll probably want to use Git, and you probably won't want your dependencies tracked.</p>

    <h2>Jekyll architecture</h2>
    <p>Templating for maximum DRYness, and deploys to GH Pages with ease.</p>

    <h2>Flat UI</h2>
    <p>Prototype comes bundled with the <a href="http://bootswatch.com/flatly/">Flatly theme</a>, giving your site a consistent and beautiful look and feel.</p>
